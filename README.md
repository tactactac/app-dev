[**Dunkirk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_(2017_film)) is a 2017 World War 2 film by *Christopher Nolan* and is one of my favourite movies. The soundtrack by *Hans Zimmer* brings the film to life as it adds a lot of suspense. The dialouge are few and far between, making the viewer focus on the bleak visuals.
